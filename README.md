Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Michael!

I am a Navy Veteran and currently enrolled in the Game Studies and Design and Criticism Major.<br />
My hobbies are watching anime, reading manga, working on my car, and playing video games.
I mainly play shooter style games on PC and racing and other games on XBox.
I am working on a app development project that will show service members 3D models of how to properly 
wear their uniforms as well as how to properly set up their awards.<br/>

I plan on streaming some of my app development on Twitch.<br />

If you have any questions or would like to learn more about me, feel free to put your questions down below.
